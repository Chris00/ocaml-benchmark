	* benchmark.ml: Code mostly rewritten to improve clarity (and to
	correct some bugs).  Allows to return multiple times for a given
	test.  Student's statistical test to determine whether two rates
	are significantly different (see [log_gamma], [betai],
	[cpl_student_t], [comp_rates] and [different_rates]).

	* benchmark.mli: The documentation is greatly improved.  Functions
	[make], [add], [sub] instead of [create], [sum], [diff] for
	uniformness with the OCaml standard library.
