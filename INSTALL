                      INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Unix (including MacosX)

Build the library:

	$ make

If you want to test it, use (requires findlib)

	$ make examples

Install it (requires findlib):

	$ make install

Clean up the build and examples directory:

	$ make clean

Remove the installed library (requires findlib):

	$ make uninstall


"findlib" is available at
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/download-caml.html

If installing a bundle of libraries, these same commands work in the
parent directory, and furthermore, the ordering of the build due to
the library interdependies are taken care of for you.


* Windows

A file "Make.bat" is provided for compilation (you may want to comment
some lines if you do not have ocamlopt working).  You will have to
install benchmark.mli, benchmark.cmi, benchmark.cma (and possibly)
benchmark.cmxa to your desired location by hand.
