           INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

["findlib" is a pre-requisite for build and installation.
  http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/download-caml.html]

Build the library:

 > make

Install it:

 > make install

Clean up the build directory:

 > make clean

Remove the installed library:

 > make uninstall


If installing a bundle of libraries, these same commands work in the
parent directory, and furthermore, the ordering of the build due to
the library interdependies are taken care of for you.
