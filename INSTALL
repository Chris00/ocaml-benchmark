                      INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Build the library:

	$ make

If you want to test it, use (requires findlib)

	$ make examples

Install it (requires findlib):

	$ make install

Clean up the build and examples directory:

	$ make clean

Remove the installed library (requires findlib):

	$ make uninstall


"findlib" is available at
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/download-caml.html

If installing a bundle of libraries, these same commands work in the
parent directory, and furthermore, the ordering of the build due to
the library interdependies are taken care of for you.
