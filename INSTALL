           INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Build the library:

$ make

Install it:

$ make install

The default install script uses "findlib":
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/download-caml.html

Clean up the build directory:

$ make clean

Remove the installed library (requires findlib):

$ make uninstall


If installing a bundle of libraries, these same commands work in the
parent directory, and furthermore, the ordering of the build due to
the library interdependies are taken care of for you.
