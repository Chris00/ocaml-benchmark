                      INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Build the library:

	$ ocamlbuild benchmark.cma benchmark.cmxa

If you want to test it, use (requires findlib)

	$ ocamlbuild examples.byte
	$ ocamlbuild examples.native

	The compiled programs are in _build/examples/.  You can run a
	specific example, say examples/ar-ba.ml, in (say) native code
	by issuing (you need not to compile the examples before if you
	use this way):

	$ ocamkbuild examples/ar-ba.native --

Install it:

	$ ./build/install

Clean up the build and examples directory:

	$ ocamlbuild -clean

Remove the installed library:

	$ ./build/uninstall


* Windows (until ocamlbuild works properly on that platform)

A file "Make.bat" is provided for compilation (you may want to comment
some lines if you do not have ocamlopt working).  You will have to
install benchmark.mli, benchmark.cmi, benchmark.cma (and possibly)
benchmark.cmxa to your desired location by hand.
