* benchmark.ml: Code mostly rewritten to improve clarity (and to
  correct some bugs).  Allows to return multiple times for a given
  test.  Student's statistical test to determine whether two rates
  are significantly different (see [log_gamma], [betai],
  [cpl_student_t], [comp_rates] and [different_rates]).

* benchmark.mli: The documentation is greatly improved.  Functions
  [make], [add], [sub] instead of [create], [sum], [diff] for
  uniformness with the OCaml standard library.
