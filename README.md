Benchmark â€” measure/compare run-time of OCaml functions
=======================================================

Benchmark provides functions to measure and compare the run-time of
functions.  It is inspired by the Perl module of the same name.


Installation
------------

The easier way to install it is by using opam:

    opam install benchmark

If you want to perform this operation manually, see `benchmark.opam`
for installation instructions.
